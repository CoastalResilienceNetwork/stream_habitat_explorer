Impacts on aquatic systems may be exacerbated by warming stream temperatures and increased precipitation.

A sensitivity index was calculated based on the highest sensitive value from both data sets. Note that some areas on Long Island and at the periphery of the state were not evaluated.

										"help":"The Aridity Index is a metric of moisture stress in a system (lower aridity index represents higher moisture stress) and is calculated from precipitation and Potential Evapotranspiration (PET). PET represents the water that an ecosystem could potentially use though evaporation and transpiration. PET is higher with warmer temperatures and more daylight hours. The ratio of precipitation (AET) to PET was summed over all months for a given year, with the modification that precipitation is capped at PET for each month (no surplus is considered when calculating this version of the Aridity Index). Change in aridity was calculated by subtracting the historical average from the future projection, and was smoothed to a 30m resolution. A positive change indicates that water stress is predicted to be lower in the future, while negative values indicate greater water stress under climate change. Aridity Index data were obtained from climatewizardcustom.org for 1962-1991 and a future projection for 2040-2069, using the ensemble average circulation model and the A2 scenario.",
